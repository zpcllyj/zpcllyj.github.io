## Dynamics of Atmospheric Coastal Low-Level Jets <small>(Advisor: Prof. Eli Tziperman)</small>

Coastal low-level jets are equatorward lower tropospheric winds along the eastern boundaries of extratropical and subtropical oceans extending from the surface to about 2 km height. These jets are one of the main components of the surface branch of the Hadley circulation, and have a profound influence on local land climate conditions and local ocean circulation and upwelling. In this study, we examine the occurrence and distribution of these jets using both reanalysis data and a global climate model simulation, and use their vorticity budget to understand their dynamics. We find that in the regions of these eastern boundary jets, the most important term in the vorticity budget is the stretching term. The stretching term is balanced by a combination of meridional advection of the planetary vorticity ($\beta$ effect) as well as the curl of friction, which also play a non-negligible role in the vorticity budget of these jets.

## Antarctic Precipitation and Sea ice Response to Stratospheric Ozone Depletion and Recovery <small>(Advisor: Prof. Yongyun Hu)</small>

The snow and total precipitation responses to Antarctic stratospheric ozone depletion and recovery are studied with model simulations. The total precipitation is shown increasing during the ozone depletion period, yet snow fall decreases near the edge of sea ice. Our research shows that the cloud changes induced by ozone depletion causes precipitation to increase, and the low-level air warming turns a large part of snowfall into rainfall. The situation is well opposite when the ozone layer recovers. With relatively high albedo, this variation of snowfall can significantly modify radiation balance and further plays a non-negligible role in sea ice forming and melting.
